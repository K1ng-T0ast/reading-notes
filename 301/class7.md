    Typically involves two roles, driver and navigator. The driver is typing and handles all the mechanics of coding like text editing, file switching, version control, and writing code. Navigator uses words to guide the driver, thinks big picture, what might come next, how an idea might be converted into code, all while scanning for typos and bugs.
