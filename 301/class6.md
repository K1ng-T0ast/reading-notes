# REST and APIs

## REST API

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    A comp scientist who helped write the first web servers. 

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    Because we have no context or resources associated with all of the machines in the world including their location and what they have to represent. The way we have been using techniques in this class is primarly to express ideas locally. 

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    It is the foundation of the web and is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.

4. What does a GET do?

    A GET is a type of HTTP verb that retrieves data from a server. When you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

5. What does a POST do?

    A POST is an HTTP verb used to send data to a server to create a resource.

6. What does PUT do?

    PUT is an HTTP verb used to send data to a server to update a resource.

7. What does PATCH do?

    PATCH is an HTTP verb used to send data to a server to partially update a resource.
