# Reading Notes

## HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?
   - It is one of the main points of interaction between a website and its user. Allowws for a two way communication between the user and the iterface rather than just receiving information.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
   - Keep them simple and small, keep them usable, keep it a conversation, order logically, group together related information, remove clutter, create space when necessary, top to bottom alignment.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
   - Labels: Tell users what the corresponding input fields mean.
   - Input Fields: Enable users to provide feedback - for example, text fields, password fields, checkbox fields, radio buttons, sliders, etc.
   - Actions: Links or buttons that when pressed by the user will trigger an action such as a form submission.
   - Messages: Give users feedback based on their input. They can be positive or negative
   - Validations: These ensure that the data submitted by the user conforms to the acceptable parameters.

## Learn JS, Events

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
   - It's like a trigger that is fired when something happens on a website, like clicking a button. When the website 'hears' that trigger, it responds with its reaction like saying, 'I see you just clicked that button, let me show you what happens now.'

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
   - Providing the string to indicate what we want to listen to and on which event
   - A function to call when the event happens.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
   - Its a parameter specified with a name like event that is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra functionality and information. It can useful when you want to pass something onto a specific element the even occured upon instead of an entire event.
