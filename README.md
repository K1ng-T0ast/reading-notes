## Growth Mindset

> _"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." -Wayne Gretzky <sub> -Michael Scott </sub>_

To me, the growth mindset is a continuous battle between our worst inhibitions and best inclinations. It is a daily reminder that we're given one shot at life and that there are tenets to guide us should the odds feel stacked against us. A growth mindset is a one that is executed with a core set of values for the purpose of edification. It is the perpetual engagment of these values to further the human experience and lean into our greater inclinations.

### Reminders

1. Always be curious, always ask the questions both easy and tough. Be ready to adapt.
2. Your mind is as free as your front door, if it's open then it invites discovery. The more minds you invite often the greater the discovery. 
3. Your greatest success is often at the top of a myriad of failures. Optimism breeds ambition and fuels personal trust in the process.
