# **What is a Text Editor?**

+ A piece of software that lets you manage lines of text, most often in tandem with code creation and manipulation
+ Important features include code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, and extension selection
+ *code completion* can be especially useful, as this will prevent typos and allow your workflow to be faster
+ Themes will increase productivity by reducing eye fatigue by allowing the contrast of colors and darker backdrops
+ Many text editors come preinstalled but lack feature sets and upgradeability
