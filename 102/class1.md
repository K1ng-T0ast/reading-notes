## What Even IS Markdown and WHY is Markdown??

While I won't go into the philosophical discussion, here are some pointers to help you get started with some basic markdown commands and what they do. First, noticed how the first line is super big? That's called a header, and you can denote a header in markdown by using the pound/hash symbol. Make sure you use a space after to make sure the function sticks.

*But what if I wanted to have more than one header?*

I'm glad you asked, you can add another hash/pound symbol or even a third one to separate rows of headers. Below is an example. Did you see what I did with the question? Italicized! It's easy to do with an asterick before and after the text.

## Example of a 2nd Header

### Example of a 3rd Header

*Okay cool, but what if I wanted to make sure my question grabbed the attention of the reader with bold text?*

Easy peasy, just add a double asterick before and after the line of text. If you wanted to also use italics, you can also input two underscores along with the asterick for the italics, like this:

__*This are the markup droids you were looking for*__

Want more? What if you wanted to list out all the ways you politely disagree that the new Star Wars trilogy is good? If you have 3 really good points in order of importance, you could just number out your list like this:

1. Super important point
2. Important point
3. Not so important point

If you want to rant about something but make it look like you're level headed, you may want an unordered list, for that you can add a plus symbol, a dash, or a single asterick to make an unordered list, like this:

+ I really want

* To say something

- You won't like to hear about the new Star Wars trilogy

- Sorry not sorry

*Okay I think I'm getting it! ...Wait you don't like the new Star Wars trilogy? Can I quote you on that?*

Absolutely! Just drop in an angle bracket and it'll drop in a quote box, like so:

> *"The new Star Wars triology is like roasting marshmellows over a toxic oil drum that just caught fire" -Me*

*Wow! Thanks so much for the brief tutorial!*

You're welcome, friend!

## Growth Mindset

> _"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." -Wayne Gretzky <sub> -Michael Scott </sub>_

To me, the growth mindset is a continuous battle between our worst inhibitions and best inclinations. It is a daily reminder that we're given one shot at life and that there are tenets to guide us should the odds feel stacked against us. A growth mindset is a one that is executed with a core set of values for the purpose of edification. It is the perpetual engagment of these values to further the human experience and lean into our greater inclinations.

### Growth Mindset Reminders

1. Always be curious, always ask the questions both easy and tough. Be ready to adapt.
2. Your mind is as free as your front door, if it's open then it invites discovery. The more minds you invite often the greater the discovery.
3. Your greatest success is often at the top of a myriad of failures. Optimism breeds ambition and fuels personal trust in the process.
